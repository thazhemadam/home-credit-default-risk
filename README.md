# Home Credit Default Risk

## Abstract
Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Unfortunately, those belonging to this population are often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. <br />
In order to make sure this underserved population has a safe and positive loan experience, *Home Credit*, a consumer finance provider, makes use of a variety of alternative data (including telco and transactional information) to try to predict their clients' repayment abilities.<br />
The dataset utilized for this project consists of data accumulated and organized by said business ventures.

## Objective and Goals
The prime objective of this project is to apply statistical methods and closely interlinked machine learning algorithms to perform risk analysis of the data.<br />
This will ensure that potential clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that their respective loans are approved as necessary.<br />
This project was done as a part of the coursework for the course *Introduction to Data Science*.
